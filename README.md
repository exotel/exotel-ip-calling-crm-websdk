# ExotelCRMWebSDK (Beta)


The ExotelCRMWebSDK allows you to leverage Exotel's platform for making IP calls, with this easy to integrate feature.




# Steps

## 1. Using the Package in a Project:
### For npm users:

Refer to sample project [here](https://github.com/exotel/exotel-voip-websdk-crm-sample-app) or read on.

#### Steps:
1. You can install the package using npm:
```bash
npm install @exotel-npm-dev/exotel-ip-calling-crm-websdk
```

Or directly from GitHub:

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/exotel/exotel-ip-calling-crm-websdk.git
```
2. Simply import the ExotelCRMWebSDK in your code like this:

```js
import ExotelCRMWebSDK from "@exotel-npm-dev/exotel-ip-calling-crm-websdk";
```

### TypeScript support

The npm package publishes:
- Compiled JavaScript in `output/` (runtime)
- Type declarations in `output/*.d.ts` (TypeScript typings)

If your build pipeline can compile TypeScript from dependencies, the TypeScript sources are also shipped under `src/` and can be imported directly (advanced usage), e.g.:

```ts
import ExotelCRMWebSDK from "@exotel-npm-dev/exotel-ip-calling-crm-websdk/src/ExotelCRMWebSDK";
```

### For Non-npm users:
If you are not using a package manager like NPM, you can directly include the bundled JavaScript file that can be generated by webpack.


#### Steps: 

1. First, you should clone this repository.

2. You can install the required packages using following npm command:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Locate the **'webpack.config.js'** file in the project directory, you can find this file in the root directory of the project.

4. Run the following command to build the webpack from root directory: 
```bash
npm run bundle
```

5. Build command should create a folder called  **'target'** in the same directory.
   #### target preview:

    target/
   
        ├── beep.wav
        ├── dtmf.wav
        ├── ringbacktone.wav
        ├── ringtone.wav
        ├── crmBundle.js
        └── crmBundle.js.LICENSE.txt

6. Simply copy & paste this **'target'** folder into the project that requires CRMWebSDK.

7. You can now utilize the **'crmBundle.js'** file by including it as a script in your project.. 
```js
<script src="./target/crmBundle.js"></script>
```

### Non-npm users (recommended): download from GitHub Release

Every tagged release (tag format `v*`) automatically uploads the pre-built bundle as GitHub Release assets:
- `crm-websdk-target.zip`
- `target/crmBundle.js` (+ `*.wav` assets)

Download the zip from the latest GitHub Release and include it in your project:

```html
<script src="./target/crmBundle.js"></script>
```

## 2. Configure crmWebSDK
You can configure crmWebSDK object like this:
```js
const crmWebSDK = new ExotelCRMWebSDK(accessToken, userId, true);
```

## 3. ExotelCRMWebSDK

**constructor**

**accessToken** : This can be generated using the 
  [Create Authentication Token API](https://developer.exotel.com/api/ip-pstn-intermix-webrtc-sdk-integration#create-authentication-token)
  
  **userId** : You can get the userId using the [Application user management APIs](https://developer.exotel.com/api/ip-pstn-intermix-webrtc-sdk-integration#applications-user-management)
  
  **autoConnectVOIP** : If true, it will auto-connect device when the `ExotelWebPhoneSDK` is returned on initialization. (If you have passed false, then you must call `DoRegister` on `ExotelWebPhoneSDK`)
  
  **Initialize**
  
  Initializes the CRMWebSDK, sets up the phone object, and registers callbacks for various events.
  
  Parameters:
  
  `sofPhoneListenerCallback` (function): Callback for incoming calls.
  
  `softPhoneRegisterEventCallBack` (function, optional): Callback for soft phone register events. Default is null.
  
  `softPhoneSessionCallback` (function, optional): Callback for soft phone session events. Default is null.
  
  Returns:
  
  Promise<ExotelWebPhoneSDK | void>: A promise that resolves to an instance of ExotelWebPhoneSDK if successful, or void if unsuccessful.
  
  
## 4. Initialize method

Use the `Initialize` method on the `ExotelCRMWebSDK` object which returns Promise that resolves to `ExotelWebPhoneSDK` object.
    `ExotelCRMWebSDK` does all the work to get necessary details required for the `ExotelWebPhoneSDK`

```javascript
const crmWebPhone = await crmWebSDK.Initialize(HandleCallEvents, RegisterationEvent);
```

You must pass call events handler, registeration event handler (optional) and session callback handler (optional) to the `Initialize` method

## 5. ExotelWebPhoneSDK
   
   1. **RegisterDevice**: Registers the device with the call server.
   2. **UnRegisterDevice**: Un-registers the device from the call server.
   3. **AcceptCall**: Accept call
   4. **HangupCall**: Disconnect call
   5. **MakeCall**: (async) Method that places a call
        
        **Number**: A number to dial

        **dialCallback**: It is called after the call request is made to the server (An actual call may start after this with a slight day).

        **CustomField**: String; Any application-specific value like order id that will be passed back as a parameter in status callback.

   7. **ToggleHold**: Toggle state hold/un-hold state of a call. This state needs to be maintained by the client
   8. **ToggleMute** Toggle state mute/un-mute state of a call. This state needs to be maintained by the client
